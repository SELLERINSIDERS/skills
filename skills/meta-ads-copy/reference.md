# Meta Ads Copy — Reference & Examples

## Copy Examples by Persona

### Comparison Shopper
**Hook style**: "I compared X..." — appeals to the rational buyer who wants data.

**Primary Text (Short)**:
"I compared 5 of the most popular stress and sleep supplements side by side. Ingredient quality. Clinical dosing. Third-party testing. The differences between them were bigger than I expected."

**Primary Text (Medium)**:
"With so many stress and sleep supplements claiming to be different, I decided to put the top sellers to an actual test. I compared their ingredient forms, dosing transparency, and independent lab certifications. Some formulas scored well across the board — others had surprising gaps."

**Primary Text (Long)**:
"I spent weeks digging into the most popular stress and sleep supplements on the market. Instead of trusting labels, I compared what's actually inside — the ingredient forms, whether the doses match published research, and which brands invest in third-party testing. The full comparison is in our latest review."

**Headlines**:
- "I compared the top stress & sleep supplements"
- "See how the top sellers actually compared"
- "The supplement comparison most people skip"

### Foggy Morning Person
**Hook style**: Relatable morning-after experience — grogginess as a comparison criterion, NOT an attack on any product.

**Primary Text (Short)**:
"Waking up feeling foggy from a sleep aid defeats the purpose. In our comparison of 5 popular stress and sleep formulas, we looked at which options are designed without next-day grogginess as a trade-off."

**Primary Text (Medium)**:
"One of the biggest differences between stress and sleep supplements? How you may feel the morning after. We compared 5 popular formulas on ingredients, dosing, and grogginess potential. Not all approaches are the same — see how they compared."

**Headlines**:
- "Sleep support without the morning fog"
- "We compared supplements on grogginess"
- "Which formulas are designed for mornings too?"

---

### Label Reader
**Hook style**: Transparency and skepticism — proprietary blends, hidden doses, generic vs. patented ingredients.

**Primary Text (Short)**:
"Some of the most popular stress and sleep supplements use proprietary blends — meaning you can't see the actual doses inside. We compared 5 top sellers on dosing transparency, ingredient quality, and independent testing."

**Primary Text (Medium)**:
"When we opened up the labels on 5 popular stress and sleep supplements, the differences were eye-opening. Some listed every dose. Others hid behind proprietary blends. Some used patented ingredient forms. Others used generic versions. See the full comparison."

**Headlines**:
- "What's actually in your supplements?"
- "The label gaps most people never notice"
- "Proprietary blends vs. full transparency"

---

### Overwhelmed Searcher
**Hook style**: Simplification — too many options, need someone to narrow it down.

**Primary Text (Short)**:
"With dozens of stress and sleep supplements on the market, choosing the right one is overwhelming. We narrowed it down to 5 top sellers and compared them side by side on what actually matters."

**Headlines**:
- "Before you buy another supplement"
- "The comparison guide you need first"
- "We narrowed down the top 5 for you"

---

### Pattern Recognizer
**Hook style**: Trend awareness — new research, growing interest in specific ingredients.

**Primary Text (Short)**:
"Interest in saffron and magnesium-based formulas has been growing as new research becomes available. We compared the top stress and sleep supplements to see which ones actually match the published studies."

**Headlines**:
- "I didn't expect these results"
- "The supplement comparison 2026 needed"
- "New research is changing the conversation"

---

### Authority Reviewer
**Hook style**: Expert credibility — team review, objective methodology.

**Primary Text (Short)**:
"Our review team compared the top-selling stress and sleep supplements on three criteria: ingredient quality, clinical dosing, and real-world usability. The differences between formulas were more significant than expected."

**Headlines**:
- "2026 supplement review: the results are in"
- "Our team reviewed the top 5 formulas"
- "The independent review you should read first"
